# rpa_codes
RPA codes that I actually wrote&amp;used for my part time job and personal usage, in order to get rid of repetitive tasks.
Used Selenium,openpyxl for weekly tasks in office, such as writing/sending weekly announcements to each class and each student.
Wrote .bat file to automatically run cmd commands.
