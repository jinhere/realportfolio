Hello, I am Eugene Kim from South Korea, a staff of the Korea Startup(K-Startup) Pavilion.
I am in charge of PULSE9, one of the 50 participating companies in the K-Startup Pavilion at CES 2023, and support them. 

PULSE9 is known for its remarkable Deep Real AI technology. With it,you can create original & attractive facial image of your virtual model. The image is rendered, based on your characterâ€™s personality, gender, ethnicity, age and so on.

We believe our technology could help you find a new virtual model for your business, with much less cost but more scalability than working with real models. 

I am writing this email to you because I find your business to be a good match for us. Please let me know, if you are interested in having a meeting with us during CES 2023.

If you have any questions or want to know more about our product, feel free to contact us.
Thank you.
